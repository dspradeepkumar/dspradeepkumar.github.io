# 1 - Educational Philosophy
My teaching philosophy is guided by the principles of Connect, Collaborate, Create, and Communicate.  I believe that education should be a collaborative and creative process that enables students to connect with their peers and the wider world. To this end, I use a variety of teaching techniques that foster active collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity.
Connect: I encourage students to connect with one another, share their ideas and experiences, and collaborate to develop new insights and perspectives.
Collaboration: Collaboration is central to my teaching philosophy. I aim to create a learning environment that supports student collaboration and encourages them to work together to solve problems and learn from one another. I provide students with opportunities to collaborate in groups, share their work, and provide feedback to one another.
Creativity: Creativity is also a crucial part of my teaching approach. I believe that creativity is an essential skill for success in the 21st century, and I encourage my students to be creative in their thinking, problem-solving, and communication. I provide them with opportunities to think outside the box, explore new ideas, and experiment with different approaches.
Communication:  Effective communication is essential for success in both academic and professional settings. I help students develop strong communication skills by providing them with opportunities to present their work, give feedback, and engage in meaningful dialogue with their peers.
	  
# 2 - Realisation of the Educational Philosophy
During my time at VIT, I had the privilege of serving as the Lab monitor and instructor for the Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms, Network Security, and Information Security Analysis and Audit courses for five semesters (January 2021 - May 2023). In this role, I taught approximately 320 students each semester for five courses and was committed to implementing my teaching philosophy to create an inclusive environment where students felt comfortable asking questions, creating project ideas, and engaging in discussions. As a proponent of the principles of Connect, Collaborate, Create, and Communicate, I worked hard to incorporate these values into my teaching style. I designed hands-on, in-class labs, providing students with opportunities to collaborate and connect with industry professionals while building critical thinking and problem-solving skills. As part of my teaching philosophy, I incorporate creativity into these activities
As a researcher, I had the opportunity to introduce the findings of my research to my students, such as the Android Framework Security that allows for impersonation using extracted identities from App’s Inter-Component Communication, which was published in HICSS'541 in 2021, and Ownership-based Encapsulation model to protect objects from aliasing that was published in ECOOP/IWACO2 in 2014.

# 3 - Results and Development
Throughout my career, I believe that mentorship is a collaborative process that involves working with students to develop their skills, knowledge, and confidence. I have had the pleasure of mentoring outstanding students, Dinesh K P, Ganesh, and Priyanka Mishra, and making them actively engaged in the process to create and explore their interests, experimenting with new ideas, and developing their own unique approaches focused on access management and matching learning in ML and Information Security.
Furthermore, I believe in finding a balance between providing sufficient guidance to prevent my mentees from feeling overwhelmed and giving them the space to explore their interests and ideas. This approach allows my mentees to take ownership of their work and feel empowered to pursue their passions. In addition to this, I recognize the importance of effective communication and work to help my mentees develop strong communication skills, which are essential for success both in academia and the professional world.

# 4 - Teaching Experience

Teaching Approaches
As a Ph.D. student and experienced software engineer with experience in teaching, research, and coding in cybersecurity, AI/ML, and software engineering, I am equipped to teach a range of undergraduate and graduate-level courses related to cybersecurity, AI/ML, and software engineering such as malware analysis, digital forensics, ML, programming language and language-based security. I will utilize my collaborations with diverse industries, and social organizations to provide students with practical insights into the field and supplement their learning with real-world examples.
To align with my teaching philosophy, I plan to incorporate a Gamification approach to teaching, which involves allowing students to practice and apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios by participating in a simulated cybersecurity and kaggle competition. By working in teams to solve a series of cybersecurity challenges that simulate real-world scenarios such as language-based security attacks, malware analysis, and data analysis, students will be able to develop their problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaboration skills, which are essential in the field of cybersecurity. This approach will make the course more engaging and interactive, providing students with hands-on experience in cybersecurity. The challenges will be designed to build upon the topics covered in class and will progressively increase in difficulty, allowing students to apply the concepts they have learned in class to solve practical problems, thereby reinforcing their knowledge.

My teaching approach aims to provide students with a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles and best practices.  Through a combination of lectures, gamification, and hands-on projects, students will gain the knowledge and skills necessary to secure computer systems and networks in today’s increasingly connected and vulnerable world, aligning with my teaching philosophy of fostering critical thinking, creativity, and a love of learning in my students.

# 5 - Educational Leadership

In the classroom, I encouraged my students to justify the security scenarios using theoretical model-based reasoning and analyze each step to gain insight into the data security and privacy mindset. By incorporating my research into my teaching, I was able to provide students with real-world examples and applications of the concepts they were learning, further reinforcing their understanding and skills in the field of computer and data security and privacy. In order to encourage the students, I create a small group among students and guide them with new project concepts based on the real-world scenarios and current industry topics. This team-based learning motivates students’ to learn new topics and prepare themselves for their future.
Throughout this period, I have refined my teaching methodology and developed my skills as an educator, aligning them with my teaching philosophy of fostering critical thinking, creativity, and a love of learning in my students.  I strive to create an engaging and supportive learning environment that encourages students to take an active role in their own education and develop the confidence to pursue their goals.

Additionally, it is expected that I will remain engaged through ongoing professional development opportunities and external services.

# 7 - Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing

In 2008, I started my working on dependent types and proposed a novel mechanism to design a flexible aliasing mechanism using alias count. Extention to this work is Typelets - the first research work to combine the Dependent Types with JML - a mechanism to express the dynamic access control, singleton pattern, threads etc. using numbers. I presented this in SPLASH 2010 Poster and got appreciation and comments from by Prof.Gary T. Leavens. During this conference, I got an opportunity to discuss my language for blind people JBrille to Jon L. White (General Chair ILC'2010). He appreciated the project and gave suggestion on how to improve the language by using intelligent composition and also suggested me to stay with blind people for few months to understand their life.
One of my very interesting work in the field of language-based information flow security, and type system is the Trusted Ownership, a novel method to dynamically controlling the access of the declassified information using trusted ownership types and access control policy. I presented the work at IWACO’2014 workshop co-located with ECOOP’14 and got good appreciation from the Programming Language Aliasing community (esp. from Prof. Sophia Drossopoulou). The implementation of trusted ownership is available in (https://github.com/trustedownership/jtrust).
Prior to embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I held the position of Research Scholar at Arizona State University. During my tenure there, I focused on cybersecurity attacks within the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), and my findings were published in HICSS'54. At present, I am actively involved in an Android Security project in partnership with professors from both Arizona State University and Texas A&M University.
