# Evidence of Excellence in Teaching

+ Improving student evaluations: My overall teaching evaluation scores  on labs that I have handled at VIT have demonstrated with a good feedback from students and a consistent learning interest from students in implementing the ideas discussed in lab sessions over the past 5 semesters/3 years. This progress reflects my dedication to refining my teaching methods and adapting to the diverse needs of our students. I have continually sought feedback from students and peers and actively implement changes to improve the learning experience in my classroom.

+ Mentorship and student success: As an educator, my teaching effectiveness is tremendously enhanced through the integration of hands-on learning experiences and competitive  activities, Blockchain  Innovation Challenge at ASU Skysong, National Cybersecurity R&D Roadshow, Cybersecurity Tool coding and demonstration at VIT. These events provide students with invaluable opportunities to develop practical skills, critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and  innovation in the rapidly evolving fields of cybersecurity and blockchain technology.  By facilitating the participation of diverse teams of undergraduates, postgraduates, and fellow scholars, I foster a dynamic learning environment that cultivates both the technical expertise and  interpersonal competencies necessary for success in their future careers.

+ Knowledge sharing with Ph.D. scholars: As a Ph.D. student I share my learning and industrial experience with other fellow scholars. As a researcher and an educator, I believe in creating a positive and inclusive learning environment that encourages active participation and critical thinking from scholars and thereby accelerate the outcome of the discussion. My Industry experience helped me to understand and to explain various problems domains providing a clear vision based on the real-world scenarios.

+ In summary, the feedback suggests that the course was enjoyable and intriguing, with a variety of content that kept the students engaged and motivated.  The in-class labs were particularly appreciated, providing hands-on experience in solving real-life scenarios that increased their motivation to study.

# Evidence of Excellence in Innovation and Research

+ Innovative activities for teaching: I have successfully adapted IT technology into my teaching, using tools such as the automatic grader (Teams Assignments and grades) for an efficient and fair assessment of assignments and exams, Discord for fostering real-time communication and collaboration among students, and Teams Quiz for interactive review sessions to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. In addition to those innovative methods, I also meticulously curate and supply binary analysis tools and online language tools for the hands-on labs, ensuring that students have access to a comprehensive range of virtual resources that not only enhance their learning experience but also empower them to effectively explore the intricacies of privacy and security in a safe and controlled environment.

+ Innovation  Challenge:  The Blockchain Innovation Challenge at ASU Skysong served as a platform for our team to delve into the potential applications of blockchain technology and contribute to the establishment of a foundation for its practical implementation.  Our cutting-edge idea, the ”Blockchain-based Key Generation Mechanism,” was awarded as “Most Innovative Capability” in 2019. Despite encountering technical and non-technical challenges, our team’s efforts showcased the potential for blockchain to transform various industries, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and education.

+ Research activities: In a recent corporate experience, I was able to successfully adapt the Large-Language Model (LLM), the most recent generative AI technology, for creating security CAPTCHAs. Taking advantage of the success, I coded and created a prototype CAPTCHA engine based on generative AI. 

+ I worked on the Android app communication security study in SEFCOM Labs in 2019 as a study Scholar at Arizona State University, guided by Prof.Yan, Prof.Tiffany, Prof.Fish, and Prof.Adam and published our research work in HICSS’54 (2021)1. 

+ I am happy to say that I collaborated with Dr. Jaejong Baek on a study to analyze the LTE network traffic patterns and that our work has recently been approved for publication at IEEE/IFIP DSN 2023. 

+ I had the pleasure of working on the static analysis of Android corporate applications alongside Dr. Carlos Rubio Medrano and Dr. Jaejong Baek, and we excitingly published our research paper in Information Systems Frontiers.
