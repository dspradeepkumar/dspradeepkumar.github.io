# Evidence of Excellence in Teaching

+ Improving student evaluations: My overall teaching evaluation scores  on labs that I have handled at VIT have demonstrated with a good feedback from students and a consistent learning interest from students in implementing the ideas discussed in lab sessions over the past 5 semesters/3 years. This progress reflects my dedication to refining my teaching methods and adapting to the diverse needs of our students. I have continually sought feedback from students and peers and actively implement changes to improve the learning experience in my classroom.

+ Mentorship and student success: As an educator, my teaching effectiveness is tremendously enhanced through the integration of hands-on learning experiences and competitive  activities, Blockchain  Innovation Challenge at ASU Skysong, National Cybersecurity R&D Roadshow, Cybersecurity Tool coding and demonstration at VIT. These events provide students with invaluable opportunities to develop practical skills, critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and  innovation in the rapidly evolving fields of cybersecurity and blockchain technology.  By facilitating the participation of diverse teams of undergraduates, postgraduates, and fellow scholars, I foster a dynamic learning environment that cultivates both the technical expertise and  interpersonal competencies necessary for success in their future careers.

+ Knowledge sharing with Ph.D. scholars: As a Ph.D. student I share my learning and industrial experience with other fellow scholars. As a researcher and an educator, I believe in creating a positive and inclusive learning environment that encourages active participation and critical thinking from scholars and thereby accelerate the outcome of the discussion. My Industry experience helped me to understand and to explain various problems domains providing a clear vision based on the real-world scenarios.

+ In summary, the feedback suggests that the course was enjoyable and intriguing, with a variety of content that kept the students engaged and motivated.  The in-class labs were particularly appreciated, providing hands-on experience in solving real-life scenarios that increased their motivation to study.
