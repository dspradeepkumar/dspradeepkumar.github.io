## Current Research Areas

I am presently engaged in the application of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Collective Intelligence to create a dynamic, decentralized learning BOT ecosystem tailored for inter-app communications within Mobile Applications. This system is designed to effectively manage uncertain knowledge and beliefs.
 

## Collaborative Works

I have experience in collaborating with clients to comprehend their problem statements and requirements, where I propose solutions and architectures to address their challenges. I possess rapid learning capabilities and the aptitude to apply my knowledge to deliver high-quality solutions within specified timelines.

Prior to embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I held the position of Research Scholar at Arizona State University. During my tenure there, I focused on cybersecurity attacks within the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), and my findings were published in HICSS'54. At present, I am actively involved in an Android Security project in partnership with professors from both Arizona State University and Texas A&M University.
