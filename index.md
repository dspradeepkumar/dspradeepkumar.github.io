Hi, my name’s Pradeep Kumar. I’m a Scientist at the Zoho Corporation, India. If you want to know more about me, feel free to take a look at my

+ [publications](./publications.md),
+ [presentations](./presentations.md),
+ [taching](./teaching.md),
+ [events](./events.md),
+ [services to the profession](./services.md),
+ [education](./education.md),
+ [employment](./employment.md), or
+ [grants and honours](./financials.md).

Most of this information can also be found bundled in my CV [here](https://github.com/alephmembeth/curriculum-vitae/blob/main/english/cv_english.pdf). If that's not enough, you may also be interested in taking a look at my

+ [latest news](./news.md),
+ [current projects](./projects.md), or
+ [contact details](./contact.md).

Inspired by [Gilad Feldman](https://mgto.org/check-me-replicate-me/), I invite you to [check and replicate my empirical work](./check.md). (Of course, replies to my theoretical work are equally welcome.)

The portrait to the left (or above, if you’re on a mobile device), by the way, was painted by the talented [Spiceestew](https://spiceestew.carrd.co/).
