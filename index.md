# Career Objective
I am Pradeep Kumar D S, PhD, and I possess more than 14 years of expertise in software programming and research.

My main areas of research focus encompass Programming Language, Android Security, Dynamic Knowledge Sharing, formal methods, Program Analysis, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. 

I am presently engaged in the application of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Collective Intelligence to create a dynamic, decentralized learning BOT ecosystem tailored for inter-app communications within Mobile Applications. This system is designed to effectively manage uncertain knowledge and beliefs.

Prior to embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I held the position of Research Scholar at Arizona State University. During my tenure there, I focused on cybersecurity attacks within the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). 

At present, I am actively involved in an Android Security project in partnership with professors from both Arizona State University and Texas A&M University.

Presently, I’m a Scientist at the Zoho Corporation, India. If you want to know more about me, feel free to take a look at my
