## Current Research Areas

I am presently engaged in the application of __Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Collective Intelligence__ to create a dynamic, decentralized learning BOT ecosystem tailored for inter-app communications within Mobile Applications. This system is designed to effectively manage uncertain knowledge and beliefs.

## Collaborative Works

I have experience in collaborating with clients to comprehend their problem statements and requirements, where I propose solutions and architectures to address their challenges. I possess rapid learning capabilities and the aptitude to apply my knowledge to deliver high-quality solutions within specified timelines.

Prior to embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I held the position of Research Scholar at Arizona State University. During my tenure there, I focused on cybersecurity attacks within the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), and my findings were published in HICSS'54. At present, I am actively involved in an Android Security project in partnership with professors from both Arizona State University and Texas A&M University.

## Some of my noteworthy research innovations include:

+ <b>Trusted Knowledge Orchestration:</b> A novel self-learning map based knowledge orchestration mechanism to classify the knowledge trustworthyness before use them for learning. 
+ <b>Proximity based Trusted Communication:</b> A dynamic system that define the agent communication payload based on the neighbours and their proximity.
+ <b>Ownership-based Encryption Protocol for Inter-component Communication in Android:</b> A combination of Symmetric Key Encryption technique and “Trustless-Computing Base (TCB)”,  protecting apps from unknown IPC attacks.
+ <b>Arc Policy Language:</b> Designed a lightweight policy language used in Android IPC to securely communicate between apps.
+ <b>Ownership-based Protocol for PendingIntent Communication: A secure lazy ownership-based communication to securly exchange privileges across process.
+ <b>Generative AI and Responsible AI based CAPTCHA Image generation adhering to geospatial constraints and policies.</b>
+ <b>Mahalanobis Distance-Based Malware Detection Plotting:</b> A lightweight technique that use Mahalanobis distance metrics (rather than using Euclidean) to identify the vulnerable app before installing them on the device.
+ <b>Blockchain for E-Governance and Supply Chain Security:</b> Presented a novel Key-Generation technique at Block Chain Innovation Challenge, Tempe, AZ. Also presented a novel technique to solve Shadow Attacks in E-Government Document Sharing.
+ <b>Blockchain Metrics:</b> A novel Blockchain Metrics combining Software Automation, NLP, and Blockchain Environment, called "Blockchain Digitizability Metrics" (a method to identify the digitizability from requirements). 


## Areas of Research
My main areas of research focus encompass Dynamic Knowledge Sharing, Encoding Bots learning and secure communication between Bots, Dynamic Program Analysis, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
