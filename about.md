# Check Me

I am Pradeep Kumar, and I possess more than 14 years of expertise in software programming and research. 

I have extensive experience across various aspects of the software industry, including identifying research challenges, developing solutions, implementing concepts, product development, and client engagement skills. I excel in research and development, particularly in problem-solving. 

## Some of my noteworthy research innovations include:

+ <b>Trusted Knowledge Orchestration:</b> A novel self-learning map based knowledge orchestration mechanism to classify the knowledge trustworthyness before use them for learning. 
+ <b>Proximity based Trusted Communication:</b> A dynamic system that define the agent communication payload based on the neighbours and their proximity.
+ <b>Ownership-based Encryption Protocol for Inter-component Communication in Android:</b> A combination of Symmetric Key Encryption technique and “Trustless-Computing Base (TCB)”,  protecting apps from unknown IPC attacks.
+ <b>Arc Policy Language:</b> Designed a lightweight policy language used in Android IPC to securely communicate between apps.
+ <b>Ownership-based Protocol for PendingIntent Communication: A secure lazy ownership-based communication to securly exchange privileges across process.
+ <b>Generative AI and Responsible AI based CAPTCHA Image generation adhering to geospatial constraints and policies.</b>
+ <b>Mahalanobis Distance-Based Malware Detection Plotting:</b> A lightweight technique that use Mahalanobis distance metrics (rather than using Euclidean) to identify the vulnerable app before installing them on the device.
+ <b>Blockchain for E-Governance and Supply Chain Security:</b> Presented a novel Key-Generation technique at Block Chain Innovation Challenge, Tempe, AZ. Also presented a novel technique to solve Shadow Attacks in E-Government Document Sharing.
+ <b>Blockchain Metrics:</b> A novel Blockchain Metrics combining Software Automation, NLP, and Blockchain Environment, called "Blockchain Digitizability Metrics" (a method to identify the digitizability from requirements). 
 
## Areas of Research
My main areas of research focus encompass Dynamic Knowledge Sharing, Encoding Bots learning and secure communication between Bots, Dynamic Program Analysis, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
